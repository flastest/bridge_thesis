// this will describe the deck, and possibly hierarchy?



//maybe there will be a function that takes a trump suit and all the played cards and determines which one is the winner?



struct card{
	// find some clever way to keep track of the suit, the trump suit, and the value of the card without doing anything too heavy on memory
	// or anything too annoying. no bullshit like "ace of clubs". that just generates tonnnnnns of spaghetti code :(


	//idk this is a card or something, it's got cards in it and stuff. I also would need a deck



	//maybe the deck can go here, in the card?
	// i think this will have things like "shuffle" and pop from deck?
